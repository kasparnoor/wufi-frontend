# Next.js App Router Structure

The Wufi Storefront uses Next.js App Router with the following organization:

## Key Components
- [src/app/layout.tsx](mdc:src/app/layout.tsx) - Root layout containing global providers
- [src/app/[countryCode]](mdc:src/app/[countryCode]) - Country-specific routes
- [src/middleware.ts](mdc:src/middleware.ts) - Handles routing, redirects, and language detection

## Route Structure
- Routes are organized by country code, allowing for localization
- The `[countryCode]` dynamic segment contains all localized pages
- Server components are used extensively for data fetching

## Internationalization
- i18next is used for translations
- The middleware detects the user's language and redirects accordingly
- Locale data is managed in the i18n directory
