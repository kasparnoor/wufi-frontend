# Development Workflow

## Local Development
- Use `yarn dev` to start the development server on port 8000
- The project requires a running Medusa backend (typically on port 9000)

## Scripts
All scripts are defined in [package.json](mdc:package.json):
- `yarn dev` - Start development server with turbopack
- `yarn build` - Build for production
- `yarn start` - Start production server
- `yarn lint` - Run ESLint

## Environment Variables
Required environment variables are checked in [check-env-variables.js](mdc:check-env-variables.js).

## Deployment
The storefront is designed to be deployed to a Node.js hosting platform like Vercel.
