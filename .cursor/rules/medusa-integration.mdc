# Medusa Integration

The Wufi Storefront integrates with Medusa, an open-source headless commerce engine.

## Key Integration Points
- Uses the Medusa JS SDK for all commerce operations
- Data fetching is primarily done via server components
- Product, cart, and checkout flows are built on Medusa APIs

## Commerce Modules
These modules handle specific commerce functionality:
- [src/modules/products](mdc:src/modules/products) - Product display and search
- [src/modules/cart](mdc:src/modules/cart) - Shopping cart management
- [src/modules/checkout](mdc:src/modules/checkout) - Checkout process
- [src/modules/account](mdc:src/modules/account) - User accounts and orders

## Data Flow
- Server components fetch data directly from Medusa API
- Client components use React Server Actions for mutations
- Cart state is managed with cookies and server-side storage
